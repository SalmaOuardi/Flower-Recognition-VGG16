#### Achievements / Tasks:
	
* Executed a multi-class image classification project on a flower dataset of 3670 images, divided into 5 classes: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, and tulips.
* Leveraged Transfer Learning with the TensorFlow implementation of the VGG16 architecture to achieve the image classification task.
* Implemented two image generators for training and validation data using the ImageDataGenerator class from the TensorFlow library.
* Designed the generators to apply multiple data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the model.
* Conducted fine-tuning on the pre-trained VGG16 architecture.
* Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the validation set, demonstrating its efficacy in solving the image classification problem.

#### About Dataset
To download the Database: [Flowers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) 
##### Context
This dataset contains 4242 images of flowers.
The data collection is based on the data flicr, google images, yandex images.
You can use this datastet to recognize plants from the photo.

##### Content
The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion.
For each class there are about 800 photos. Photos are not high resolution, about 320x240 pixels. Photos are not reduced to a single size, they have different proportions!
